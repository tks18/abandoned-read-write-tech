In an attempt to streamline the payments process in Google Chrome on Windows 10, Google is now rolling out support for Windows Hello biometric authentication in the browser. The feature, which was recently spotted by a user on Twitter, will allow you to authenticate purchases on Google Chrome using Windows Hello’s fingerprint or face recognition.

In case you own a Windows Hello capable device, you can enable the feature in Google Chrome by heading over to the Settings page in the browser and selecting Payment Methods. Here, tap on the toggle next to the Windows Hello option to enable the feature. Once the feature is enabled, Chrome will bring up a Windows Hello prompt every time you select a card to make a payment on the browser. Clicking on the Use Windows Hello button in the prompt will then allow you to enter your card’s CVC number using either facial recognition or the fingerprint scanner.

As of now, we can’t be sure when exactly Google enabled the feature in Chrome as a post on the Google Support forum suggests that it’s been around since March. It’s also worth noting that XDA Senior Member Some_Random_Username also spotted the feature in Chrome Canary v82.0.4085.4 all the way back on March 14th. The feature appears to have been enabled by a server-side update and should be available for all Google Chrome users running the latest build of the browser.
