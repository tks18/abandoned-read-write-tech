            <title>Telegram 7.4 makes it easy to migrate your WhatsApp chat history</title>
            <description>The update brings a new import feature that will help users migrate their chat history</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Telegram and Signal are reaping the benefits of the recent backlash against WhatsApp. The apps have gained several hundred thousand users over the last couple of weeks, and their growth doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon. In a bid to attract even more WhatsApp users, these apps have been working on bringing new features to get at par with the Facebook-owned messenger. For instance, Signal recently added custom wallpaper and animated sticker support to the app to offer new users a more familiar experience. Now, Telegram is adding a new tool in version 7.4 that will help users...</content:encoded>

            <title>Google Messages prepares end-to-end encryption for RCS</title>
            <description>End-to-End Encryption for RCS</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, our friends at AndroidPolice got their hands on Google Messages 6.2.031 and uploaded it to APKMirror. Our friend Quinny899 notified us that this APK is actually a dogfood build, meaning it was not supposed to be released to the public. Sometimes, these dogfood builds have a lot of interesting code for features that are in development, and Messages 6.2.031 is definitely one of those cases. This dogfood build hints that Google is preparing end-to-end encryption for RCS messages, Google Fi account integration to sync calls, texts, and voicemails, and manual cloud restores of backups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;endtoend-encryption-for-rcs&quot;&gt;End-to-End Encryption for...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp for Android operates in two public branches: stable and beta. While the stable branch is where you want to be as the average user, the beta branch gives us the opportunity to witness the features that are in development for this popular instant messaging app. Past WhatsApp Betas have shown off hints for upcoming features such as multi-device support, expiring messages, Facebook story sharing, animated stickers, and even the famed dark theme. A previous beta had also spotted hints for QR code support for profiles, and now, the latest beta brings over support for the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As reported by...</content:encoded>

            <title>Discord for Android rolls out noise suppression</title>
            <description>powered by Krisp</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since its debut back in 2015, Discord has evolved quite a bit and it’s now one of the most popular instant messengers for gamers and professionals alike. One of the main reasons behind Discord’s popularity is the sheer number of features it offers, both for text-based communication and VoIP calls. To provide users the best calling experience on the platform, Discord introduced a new noise suppression feature powered by Krisp for the desktop client earlier this year in April. The feature makes use of machine learning to remove background noise and, after using it for the last few weeks, I...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to streamline the payments process in Google Chrome on Windows 10, Google is now rolling out support for Windows Hello biometric authentication in the browser. The feature, which was recently spotted by a user on Twitter, will allow you to authenticate purchases on Google Chrome using Windows Hello’s fingerprint or face recognition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case you own a Windows Hello capable device, you can enable the feature in Google Chrome by heading over to the Settings page in the browser and selecting Payment Methods.

            <description>To help protect against accidental copyright infringement</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Instagram has posted its guidelines for using copyrighted music during live videos, Stories, and other posts on the platform, and part of the announcement includes a new update to the notification that pops up to tell users they’re using unlicensed art in ways that violate its rules. The changes to the pop-up notification are designed around helping users avoid Instagram’s automated interruptions — like muting or outright blocking — that occurs if a piece of licensed music plays for too long over or in the background of a live video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the notification pops up earlier in live broadcasts to...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;witter made it easier to see quote tweets on iOS on May 12th, and that new functionality is now available on Twitter for Android and for the web, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you tap or click on the “Retweets” word on a tweet, you’ll be taken to a new page that lets you look at one of two columns: a column showing retweets with comments and a column showing all retweets without comments. You can see how it works in the video below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There’s now more to the conversation behind the Retweet count.

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Netflix is trying to make it easier for people to cancel their service with a new automated prompt that will ask subscribers if they want to continue paying after a lengthy period of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On May 18th, the company started reaching out to subscribers who haven’t used the service in two years (or within one year of their initial sign-up for newer customers) to let them know they can either keep their membership or have it canceled upon the next billing cycle. Those customers represent a small number of Netflix’s overall 183 million subscriber base, totaling less than half of...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is creating a new kind of Office document. Instead of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, the company has created Lego blocks of Office content that live on the web. The tables, graphs, and lists that you typically find in Office documents are transforming into living, collaborative modules that exist outside of traditional documents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft calls its Lego blocks Fluid components, and they can be edited in real time by anyone in any app. The idea is that you could create things like a table without having to switch to multiple apps to get it done, and the table will persist...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Google announced support for HDR content on Google Play Movies &amp;amp; TV. The company specifically mentioned HDR10+, but we knew it was preparing to support Dolby Vision HDR as well. Today, we’re seeing a batch of Dolby Vision HDR titles available on the platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joker and A Simple Favor are the first two Dolby Vision HDR titles on Google Play Movies. It appears that Google is preparing to announce official support as there is a “Top Dolby Vision movies” section when you search for “Dolby.” Play Movies is still well behind other platforms when it comes to...</content:encoded>

In a nutshell, it’s an app that allows you to create buttons on the home screen to perform Google Assistant commands.

The updated UI included a new tab for static lyrics at the bottom of the music player, alongside the Up Next tab which lists all songs in the current playlist. Now, according to a couple of recent posts on Reddit, YouTube Music is getting a new “Related” tab in the same position on the player page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2020/05/YouTube-Music-Related-tab-975x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Youtube Music&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, the Related tab lists down recommended songs and playlists based on whatever you’re currently listening to.

            <description>Google wants the future of email to be less static and more interactive</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Google wants the future of email to be less static and more interactive. Its solution based on Accelerated Mobile Pages has found industry support, and “dynamic email” is now coming to Gmail for Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of clicking links that open in a browser, dynamic emails let you interact with calendar invites, respond to questionnaires, and browse catalogs right from a message. One particularly interesting use case is commenting in a Google Docs thread right from the email notification already in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This saves you from having to open the full app and lets you quickly return to...</content:encoded>

            <description>The Motorola Razr is likely the most iconic flip phone ever released.</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Motorola Razr is likely the most iconic flip phone ever released. In 2011, Motorola and Verizon tried to revive the brand with a series of thin — for their time — Android phones. The Lenovo-owned company is now bringing back the Razr as an Android Foldable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2019 Razr offers much more compelling hardware that harkens to its namesake. When closed, it keeps the original look of the flip phone, albeit wider. In clamshell mode, there is an outer 2.7-inch 800 x 600 “Quick View” screen that notes networking and battery status up top, followed by the time, date...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, YouTube Music has relied on playlists from the service’s curators to automated creations based on your listening history. The latest that’s beginning to roll out is called the “Discover Mix.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Google added a new “Released” playlist to compete with Apple Music’s “New Music Daily” and Spotify’s “New Music Friday.” The “Discover Mix” is very similar in concept to the latter service’s very popular “Discover Weekly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover art uses the full YouTube logo — instead of Music’s round icon — in the top-left corner and has a very neon aesthetic of an abstract and bright...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Views on YouTube are a huge pop culture metric that define popularity and success. Google today is launching YouTube Music Charts in India, thus “closing a critical gap.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;India has long been one of the most unique and vibrant music markets in the world. Nowhere is that more visible than on YouTube. We look forward to celebrating the success of the artists, songs and music videos that are resonating with Indian music fans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;YouTube’s Music Charts track artists, songs, music videos, and what’s trending.

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen in recent Pixel 4 leaks, Google has a number of design changes in mind in the near future for the Google Assistant on Pixel phones. For those of us who won’t be getting the “next-generation” Assistant right away, Google is also testing out a new UI for its proactive suggestions on Android.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it stands today, when you invoke the Google Assistant on Android, you’re presented with the typical voice UI and a number of suggested actions contained in pill-shaped “chips.” While they flow nicely with the Material Design spec, these chips are not particularly good for...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Pixel 4 has leaked so many times this month that we’re getting tired of the early looks, but now another huge gallery of pictures has hit the web which further corroborates other leaks and reports about the device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, there’s really not much we don’t know about the Pixel 4. Many of the details about the device we previously exclusively reported on such as the 90Hz display, 128GB of storage, and more are confirmed in a gallery of over 20 images that were sent to The Verge. Notably, the device pictured if apparently “not a final unit.”&lt;/p&gt;...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the launch of Android 10 last week, Google teased night-friendly looks for Gmail and Maps. A dark theme for Google Assistant and Search is now beginning to roll out for some users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve been tracking development on a dark mode for the Google app, which incorporates Assistant, since April. Limited testing began in June and a wider launch might now be underway. There are several reports on Pixel and Samsung devices with both Search and Assistant adopting it simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google Discover adopts a dark theme that is similar to what’s long been at the left of the Pixel Launcher....</content:encoded>

            <description>Nobody likes to wear helmets!</description>
            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to wear helmets! Unless, you’re a bike-enthusiast who takes pride flaunting his riding essentials, helmets are a pain. They’re heavy and suffocating even though they save lives. Besides, the new traffic rules have got people fussing about having to wear a helmet on sunny days. That’s another level of discomfort altogether. But, a man has now devised a very ingenious hack to solve all your riding woes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sandeep Dahiya, director at a multinational company, has developed a prototype model of an air-conditioned helmet that can keep you cool while riding under the scorching sun. Passionate about designing user-friendly...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following Android 10’s public launch last week, many users have been waiting for all of Google’s apps to offer darker looks. After a brief tease on Android.com, a dark theme is now rolling out to Gmail for Android today via a sever-side update.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like other Google apps in recent months, there are three options in Gmail: Light, Dark, and System default. The dark theme is quite straightforward with the email client adopting a dark gray for the background and navigation drawer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that latter part of the UI, a red accent color is still leveraged to note what inbox you’re...</content:encoded>

            <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Google’s latest news initiative has Search “elevating original reporting.” This will see articles that broke a story — instead of reblogs — be prominently featured to people searching and stay visible longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Google, this is meant to account for how “original reporting on a subject doesn’t always stay in the spotlight for long” in today’s “fast-paced world of news.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many news articles, investigations, exclusive interviews, or other work can be so notable that they generate interest and follow-up coverage from other publications. And in other cases, many stories cover a single news development, with all of them...</content:encoded>
